	GUI or Graphical User Interface is a form of a UI for a person to interact with a computer. It uses visual icons like menus, folders, and buttons that the user can interact with to change things on the computer. Users are also able to drag and drop files to where they want to go. GUIs were made because it allowed for less experienced people to interact with their computers. GUIs are used far more commonly the CLIs because of the lower barrier to entry. CLI or Command Line Interface is another form of UI. It uses a text-based system for user interaction rather than graphics. A user is able to accomplish tasks faster using a CLI if they are experienced enough. CLIs were used a lot more often in the earlier days of computers because they lacked the processing power to display a GUI. The big difference between a GUI and a CLI is how the user gets feedback from the computer. The user gets feedback from a GUI from menus and popups. A CLI gives feedback through text output in the terminal.
