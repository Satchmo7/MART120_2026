	Of course learning styles affect how we learn. We are much more likely to remember something we're taught if the teaching method coincides with our own learning styles. Our engagement with the material also improves if we can more effectively learn something. My results were a good representation of how I learn. A concept that is explained well with clear to understand visuals is how I learn best. Utilizing the most of audio and visual teaching helps me remember the most.
